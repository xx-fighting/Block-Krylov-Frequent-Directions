## A Randomized Frequent Directions Algorithm with Block Krylov Iteration 

We provide Matlab functions for low rank approximation using r-BKIFD. For further information about our methods, please see our paper:  "An Improved Frequent Directions Algorithm for Low-Rank Approximation via Block Krylov Iteration" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11703)

### Installation

Run the file **compile_all_mex.m** inside the folder help_functions.

### Demo files

We provide two demos to compare all the algorithms

* **demo_dense**: This script gives a demo for a dense matrix
* **demo_sparse:** This script gives a demo for a sparse matrix, with only 0.1% non-zero elements
